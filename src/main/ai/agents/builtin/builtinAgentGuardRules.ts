/**
 * Tool-call conduct rules owned by Cherry's built-in Agents (Assistant / Support).
 *
 * These are the built-in Agents' own safeguards, not the runtime's cross-cutting policy, so they
 * live with the Agents that declare them: a new built-in Agent adds a row here and the runtime
 * needs no edit.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP (#18898): only the Claude Code runtime evaluates this table. Pi returns before any
 * equivalent check under bypassPermissions and dsh has none, so a built-in Agent on those runtimes
 * is not held to these rules — a pre-existing hole this table inherited, not a design choice. Do
 * not describe these as cross-runtime guarantees until every runtime shares the evaluator.
